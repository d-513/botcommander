### Pull Requests

Even if you don't know much coding feel free to PR and I will help you if there are any problems.  

To get started, fork the repo on github.  
For some changes, you can use github web editor. Otherwise, follow this simple guide:
- Copy the URL of your fork
- Paste `git clone your_url_here` in your terminal
- Open your code editor in that directory
- Type `lerna bootstrap`
- Commit the changes and push
- Create a PR in github webui
