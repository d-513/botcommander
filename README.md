Solid base for building discord bots.

### Why?

discord.js-commando was abandoned, leaving bot developers to create their own custom handlers. I got fed up with creating one for each of my bots so i'm creating botcommander

### About

BotCommander is a Typescript-based framework/library for building discord bots. It features slash commands and discord.js
