# Getting Started

::: tip
Check out [discord.js installations & preparations](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/) if you do not have Node.js installed, or don't know how to create a bot account
:::

The easiest way to get started is to use the [create](https://github.com/dada513/botcommander/tree/master/packages/create) package to scaffold a bot project.  
Open a terminal session, and type

```bash
npm install -g @botcommanderjs/create # or yarn global add @botcommanderjs/create
create-botcommander-app
```

The tool will ask you a couple of questions:

- Directory name to create the project in
- Name of your bot
- (optional, but recommended) Your name
- Language to use (pick JavaScript if you're not sure)
- If you want to use git for version control (default: no)
- The npm client to use (pick npm if you're not sure)
- Confirm

Once it is done installing, open the directory with your favorite code editor.
